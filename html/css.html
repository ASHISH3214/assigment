           <p>These are the three major benefits of CSS:</p> 

             <h3>1) Solves a big problem</h3>
<p> CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.</p>

<h3>2) Saves a lot of time</h3>
<p>CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.</p>

<h3>3) Provide more attributes</h3>
<p> provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.
